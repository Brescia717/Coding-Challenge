	<h1><strong>Welcome to my website!</strong></h1>

	<p>My name is Paul Brescia, and I'm very excited about becoming a programmer.  I have previous experience writing in C++, however this is my first time coding in HTML.  I've always been a tech savvy person.  I went to Middlesex Community College and got an Associate's degree in Life Sciences, while working at Instrumentation Laboratory in Bedford, MA.  After completing my Associates, I went to UMass Amherst to get a degree in Biology.  It wasn't until about my 3rd year in school I relaized it wasn't for me.  Sure, I loved learning about it, but the passion for doing the work wasn't there.  After school I looked for jobs in biology, but there weren't many that were for entry-level employees.  The few that I found and interviewed for left me saying to myself, "Is this really what I want to do?"  I ended up picking up a job working for Staples EasyTech in Northampton, MA while my girlfriend finished up school, and we later moved in with a few friends of mine I met in school, who were all Computer Science majors...  ALL of these guys are happy and enjoy what the do for work, most of them being programmers. That's something that I strive for - a career I would love doing.  Having watched over their shoulders when they brought some of their work home made be realize that programming was something I not only had an interest in, but it was something I would enjoy doing - something I would be passionate about. <br /> </p>

	<h2><em>Fastforward a year and a half after having moved in with my programming friends...</em> <br /></h2>

	<p>I was chatting with a friend visiting for the weekend who told me about this program that his company hires people out of, some of which have no previous programming background, and they love their jobs.  I asked my friend for the details about the program and said I'd look into it.  That night I got online and did some research about Launch Academy. After reading some reviews about Launch Academy and the career opportunities that open up for its successful candidates, I decided that programming is what I really want to do for a career.  I have a strong analytical mind and I believe I am a good candidate for Launch Academy, and I can't wait finally meet your staff in person.</p>
